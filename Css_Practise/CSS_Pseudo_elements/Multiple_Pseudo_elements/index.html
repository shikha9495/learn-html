        <h2>Multiple_Pseudo_elements</h2>
        <p>You can combine the ::first-letter and ::first-line pseudo-elements to add a special effect to the first letter and the first line of a text! Several pseudo-elements can also be combined.
        In the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in an xx-large font size. The rest of the first line will be blue, and in small-caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color.</p>
